#Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix

•	Start from top right corner. 
•	If the number is positive, it means the numbers before it are also positive. 
•	So move to next row. 
•	If the number is negative, this means that the numbers below it are also negative. Move to previous column.

##PYTHON CODE

        m = len(grid) #rows
        n = len(grid[0]) #cols
        row = 0 
        col = n-1
        count = 0 
        while (row<m and col>=0):
            if (grid[row][col]<0):
                count+= (m - row)
                col-=1
            else:
                row+=1
        return count
> The time complexity of the solution is O(m+n)
